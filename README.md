# Getting-Cleaning-Data
Data Science Course


The purpose is to create a tidy data set out of wearable computing data.

## The data source

Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
 

## Files included are
* README.md - current, briefing document
* CodeBook.md - document describing variables, data and work done to create analysis
* run_analysis.R - R code for the analysis

## run_analysis.R goals
Project instructions are as follows:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


The output is created in working directory with the name of tidydataset.txt
